/**
 * ============================================================================
 * PROJECT: College Lost and Found Management System
 * LANGUAGE: Pure C (C99 Standard compliant)
 * PLATFORM: Cross-platform (Windows & Linux/macOS compatible)
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * CORE DATA STRUCTURES:
 * 1. LINKED LIST:
 *    - Dynamically stores and manages the inventory of lost & found items.
 *    - Allows O(1) insertions at head/tail, dynamic memory expansion without
 *      fixed array bounds, and easy traversal / search / deletion.
 *
 * 2. QUEUE (FIFO - First In, First Out):
 *    - Implemented as a singly-linked FIFO Queue (front and rear pointers).
 *    - Manages pending claim requests submitted by students or front-desk staff.
 *    - Guarantees fair, first-come-first-served processing of claims.
 *
 * DATA PERSISTENCE & 1-YEAR RETENTION DATABASE:
 * - Active Items File: "items.txt"
 *   Stores active and pending items in structured delimited format.
 * - Claim History Database: "claim_history.txt"
 *   Acts as the official 1-Year Retention Archive for college audit compliance.
 *   Every time an item is claimed and handed over, full claimant details
 *   (Name, USN, Phone, College Email) and item details are permanently logged
 *   with UTC/Local timestamps for statutory audit and dispute resolution.
 * - Queue Backup File: "claims_queue.txt"
 *   Ensures pending claims are not lost across application restarts.
